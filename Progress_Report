02/12/15
**Reps: fails for E8
Subgroups: tested for up to A8, B7, C7, D8, E6, E7, F4, G2
Check: E7 -> E6xU1?? Maybe in Cartan recognisation
Decompose: tested for up to A6, B6, C6, D6, G2; fails for E6, E7, F4
--------

Reps: fails for E8
Subgroups : wrong previously, tested for up to A5, B5, C5, D5, F4, G2
--------
04/12/15
DataBase: doesn't parse weights (and lists in general) properly
--------
07/12/15
DataBase: all working properly
Irreps & Subgroups: tested up to A5, B5, C5, D5, F4, G2
**Parsing of weights slow, temporal hack: ignore parsing for r<6
Decomposition: tested up to A5, B5, C5, D5, F4, G2
Breaking Chains: tested up to A5, B5, C5, D5, F4, G2
Direct Products: tested up to A5, B5, C5, D5, F4, G2
**Something fails for E6
**Two many subgroups, maybe have copies inside the subgroup
Invariants: works but gives incomplete result for A5, B5, C5, D5, F4, G2
**Improve invariants algorithm

Parallelized model generation
---------
07/06/17
Sped up considerably all the group calculations
Implemented databases for relevant classes
Works for A1-5, B1-5, C1-5, D1-6, G2 and F4
Fails for E6
----------
